"""iCalendar output — RFC 5545, written by hand and on purpose.

Calendar clients are unforgiving. A missing CRLF, an unfolded long line, an
unescaped comma in a summary: any of them turns a working subscription into a
silent parse failure, and the client rarely says why. So this module is small,
strict, and tested against the parts of the spec that actually bite.

Two shapes, because the ask has two halves:

* **VEVENT, all-day** — a phenology event is a day, not a time. Nobody's
  dahlias bloom at 14:00. All-day means DTSTART;VALUE=DATE with DTEND the
  following day, which is the half-open convention every client expects and
  the one people most often get wrong by a day.
* **VTODO** — a task. Apple Reminders, Google Tasks and Thunderbird all read
  these from a subscribed calendar, which is what makes a to-do arrive as a
  reminder rather than as another appointment.

No dependency: `icalendar` would be a wheel to carry, a version to pin and a
transitive tree to audit, for perhaps eighty lines of string building.
